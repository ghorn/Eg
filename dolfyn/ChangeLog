December, 2007: vs. 0.420
=========================

License changed to the Apache License, v. 2.0. The change allows
others to distribute 'derived works' together with dolfyn.

November, 2007: vs. 0.410
=========================

- "restart init" will check if Nbnd and Nfaces have changed
  and act accordingly (ReadRestartField will only read Ncel items)
  
October, 2007: vs. 0.410
========================

- fixed some bugs introduced at the last stage of the may version
  (the gradients were getting messed up)

- fixed initialisation for transient run without restart (variables
  now get the guessed value instead of simply a zero).
  
- "use,gauss" will give by default "use,gauss,2"

- introduced some special ABL (atmosferic boundary layer)
  features (a combination of UserInitialField, UserInlet 
  and the command Use,FixABL...)
  
- Johan Jacobs extended the vtk output including particle tracks.

May, 2007: vs. 0.400
====================

Starting with the implementation of alternative differencing 
schemes (experimental features):

- scheme-command: 

  scheme uvw gamma 0.8
  scheme keps gamma 0.8
  scheme T gamma 0.8

  selects gamma-scheme with 20% blending of UD (T also applies 
  for Scalars)

  choices are:
  UD    standard upwind differencing
  CD    central differencing (or CD1)
  CD2   an alternative to CD1
  LUD   linear upwind differencing
  MIN   a scheme which blends UD, LUD and CD1
  GAMMA a scheme which blends UD and CD1

  default is still blending of a central differencing scheme (CD1) 
  with standard upwind differencing (UD) (command 'gamma' in 
  the din-file).
  
  please note that the higher order diffusive flux is still 
  uncorrected (unfinished). also still looking for a method 
  to correct the differencing schemes for (very) bad non-orthogonal
  mesh connectivities.
  
- print-commands:
  
  print cells 5 100 5
  print cells user
  print file  some_file_name
  
  first call selects the cells to be printed, second one
  selects a user subroutine UserPrintCell, finally the last 
  call selects a file instead of the terminal. instead of cells
  one can select wall boundaries as well.
  
- calculation of gradients:

  use,gauss,2

  selects gauss' method instead of the least squares method. the 
  number set the number of passes (iterations).

- math:

  * can be used for the inlets and walls as well now
  * case sensitivity removed
    
  example:
  
  title Leonard test semi Gamma/LS
  scheme T gamma 1.0
  use gauss

  set T 273 + 500.
  set rho 100000. / 287. / $T

  vislam  36.4e-06
  density $rho

  set  angle 30
  set  uoo 1.0
  math degrees
  math u cos $angle * $uoo
  math v sin $angle * $uoo
  
  init,field,$u $v 0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,$T
  init,steps,0

  boundary,1
  inlet
  $u $v 0.0
  $rho
  $T
  inle
  0.25 0.1

  etc.
  
- preprocessor:

  one small change (releasing memory/array TmpFace as
  soon as possible)
  
December, 2006: vs 0.311
========================

Some modifications by Harry reversed.

Main changes to the particle subroutines.

In order to generate particles more general additional
math commands have been introduced in the din-file: 
- 'set' in order to define a variable
- 'math' to do some math with a variable
- 'gene' to generate particles

Example 1:

  set np 40

  math deg
  math a1 sin 45 * 2

  use particles $np 

  set vis 0.001e-6 * 1.e6

  part         1 prop 1000 100.e-6
  gene $np - 1 1 

  part         1 init 1 0.0025 0.99 0.105  0.0  0.0 0.0
  gene $np - 1 1,,,     0.01   0.00 0.000  0.0  0.0 0.0

  VisLam $vis

  ...
  
Example 2:

  set x0  -0.0265
  set y0   0.0456
  set z0  -0.20

  set x1  -0.005

  set nr 8
  set dx $x1 - $x0 / $nr
  set dy 0.0
  set dz 0.0

  use particles $nr

  part     1 prop 1000. 20.e-6
  gene $nr - 1 1

  part         1   init 1 0.5 * $dx + $x0 $y0 $z0  0.0  0.0 0.0
  gene $nr - 1 1,,,          $dx          $dy $dz  0.0  0.0 0.0

  ...

Note that the syntax is quite simple from 'left to right' using
a '$'-sign to fetch a variable. Thus the result of '0.5 * $dx + $x0' 
(adds half dx to x0) is different to the result of '$x0 + 0.5 * $dx' 
(adds 0.5 to x0 and multiplies the lot with dx)

=======================

Modifications by Harry.

 - For CFD part, only a small modification according to
   *Muzaferija's method* was carried out in subroutine
   GradientPhi2. Then the code worked in really full-tetra meshes.

 - To make output of simulations looks correctly, several
   lines are added into InterpolateData to let dependent variables
   at wall equal to zero.

 - There are some changes in tecplt.f90.

September, 2006: vs 0.310
=========================

First clean up of particle subroutines.

June, 2006: vs 0.310
====================

This version includes:
 - Various bug fixes and some clean up
   Thanks to Bouke, Alfred, Harry
 - Experimental feature of particles
   in cooperation with Harry
 - Tecplot output written by Harry
 - dolfyn.cfg is read by the preprocessor as well
   (suggestion by Bouke, includes scaling and file type)
 - user solver interface added (request by osm)
 - tested with ifort, g95 and compaq visual fortran 6.6a
 
February, 2006: vs 0.310
=========================

Merged with the patches subroutines written by Bouke Tuinstra,
see www.home.zonnet.nl/bouke_1/dolfyn

Scalars activated; partly based on Bouke's work for the patches
as this mechanism relies on scalars.

December, 2005: vs 0.301
=========================

This version includes:
 - Multiple outlets included
 - FluxScalar cleaned up

September, 2005: vs 0.300
=========================

This version includes:
 - Various bug fixes (thanks Bouke) and clean up
 - Enhanced output
 - Heat transfer with a resistance R for walls (adapt your din-file!)
 - New commands like: relax* and gamma* (for extra options)
 - More OpenDX output
 - Complete rework of the VTK-output

June, 2005: vs 0.210
=====================

Abandoned (for now) the linear solver based on the improved
"vanilla" BiCGStab(2) iterative method.
