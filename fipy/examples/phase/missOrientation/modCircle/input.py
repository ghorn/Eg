In this example a phase equation is solved in one dimension with a
missorientation present. The phase equation is given by:

.. raw:: latex

    $$ \tau_{\phi} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} 
    = \alpha^2 \nabla^2 \phi + \phi ( 1 - \phi ) m_1 ( \phi , T) 
    - 2 s \phi | \nabla \theta | - \epsilon^2 \phi | \nabla \theta |^2 $$

where

.. raw:: latex

    $$ m_1(\phi, T) = \phi - \frac{1}{2} - T \phi ( 1 - \phi ) $$

The initial conditions are:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{align*}
   \phi &= 1 \qquad \forall x  \\
   \theta &= \begin{cases}
   2 \pi / 3 & \text{for $(x - L / 2)^2 + (y - L / 2)^2 > (L / 4)^2$} \\
   -2 \pi / 3 & \text{for $(x - L / 2)^2 + (y - L / 2)^2 \le (L / 4)^2$}
   \end{cases} \\
   T &= 1 \qquad \forall x 
   \end{align*}

and boundary conditions

.. raw:: latex

   $\phi = 1$ for $x = 0$ and $x = L$.

.. Further details of the numerical method for this problem can be found in
   "Extending Phase Field Models of Solidification to Polycrystalline
   Materials", J.A. Warren *et al.*, *Acta Materialia*, **51** (2003)
   6035-6058.  
   
Here the phase equation is solved with an explicit technique.

The solution is allowed to evolve for `steps = 100` time steps.

   >>> for step in range(steps):
   ...     phaseEq.solve(phase, dt = timeStepDuration)

The solution is compared with test data. The test data was created
with a FORTRAN code written by Ryo Kobayashi for phase field
modeling. The following code opens the file `test.gz` extracts the
data and compares it with the `theta` variable.

   >>> import os
   >>> import examples.phase.missOrientation.modCircle
   >>> filepath = os.path.join(examples.phase.missOrientation.modCircle.__path__[0], 'test.gz')
   >>> from fipy.tools import dump
   >>> testData = dump.read(filepath)
   >>> from fipy.tools import numerix
   >>> print numerix.allclose(numerix.array(testData), phase)
