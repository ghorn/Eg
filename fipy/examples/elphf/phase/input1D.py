r"""
A simple 1D example to test the setup of the phase field equation.

.. raw:: latex

   We rearrange Eq.~\eqref{eq:elphf:phase} to
   
   \begin{align*}
       \frac{1}{M_\xi}\frac{\partial \xi}{\partial t}
       &= 
       \kappa_{\xi}\nabla^2 \xi
       +
       \frac{\epsilon'(\xi)}{2}\left(\nabla\phi\right)^2
       \\
       &\qquad - 
       \left[
           p'(\xi) \Delta\mu_n^\circ
           + g'(\xi) W_n
       \right]
       - 
       \sum_{j=2}^{n-1} C_j \left[
           p'(\xi) \Delta\mu_{jn}^\circ
           + g'(\xi) W_{jn}
       \right]
       - 
       C_{\text{e}^{-}} \left[
           p'(\xi) \Delta\mu_{\text{e}^{-}}^\circ
           + g'(\xi) W_{\text{e}^{-}}
       \right]
   \end{align*}

The single-component phase field governing equation can be represented as

.. raw:: latex

   \[ \frac{1}{M_\xi} \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial t} 
   =  \kappa_\xi \nabla^2 \xi - 2\xi(1-\xi)(1-2\xi) W \]

where 

.. raw:: latex

   $\xi$ is the phase field,
   $t$  is time,
   $M_\xi$ is the phase field mobility,
   $\kappa_\xi$ is the phase field gradient energy coefficient, and
   $W$ is the phase field barrier energy.
   
We solve the problem on a 1D mesh

    >>> nx = 400
    >>> dx = 0.01
    >>> L = nx * dx
    >>> from fipy.meshes.grid1D import Grid1D
    >>> mesh = Grid1D(dx = dx, nx = nx)

We create the phase field

    >>> from fipy.variables.cellVariable import CellVariable
    >>> phase = CellVariable(mesh = mesh, name = 'xi')
    >>> import scipy
    >>> phase.mobility = scipy.inf
    >>> phase.gradientEnergy = 0.025
    
Although we are not interested in them for this problem, we create one field to 
represent the "solvent" component (1 everywhere) 

    >>> class ComponentVariable(CellVariable):
    ...     def copy(self):
    ...         new = self.__class__(mesh = self.getMesh(), 
    ...                              name = self.getName(), 
    ...                              value = self.getValue())
    ...         new.standardPotential = self.standardPotential
    ...         new.barrier = self.barrier
    ...         return new

    >>> solvent = ComponentVariable(mesh = mesh, name = 'Cn', value = 1.)
    >>> solvent.standardPotential = 0.
    >>> solvent.barrier = 1.

and one field to represent the electrostatic potential (0 everywhere)

    >>> potential = CellVariable(mesh = mesh, name = 'phi', value = 0.)
    >>> permittivityPrime = 0.
    
We'll have no substitutional species and no interstitial species in this first example

    >>> substitutionals = []
    >>> interstitials = []
    
    >>> for component in substitutionals:
    ...     solvent -= component

    >>> from fipy.terms.transientTerm import TransientTerm
    >>> from fipy.terms.implicitDiffusionTerm import ImplicitDiffusionTerm
    >>> from fipy.terms.implicitSourceTerm import ImplicitSourceTerm
    
    >>> phase.equation = TransientTerm(coeff = 1/phase.mobility) \
    ...     == ImplicitDiffusionTerm(coeff = phase.gradientEnergy) \
    ...     - (permittivityPrime / 2.) \
    ...        * potential.getGrad().dot(potential.getGrad())
    
    >>> enthalpy = solvent.standardPotential
    >>> barrier = solvent.barrier
    >>> for component in substitutionals + interstitials:
    ...     enthalpy += component * component.standardPotential
    ...     barrier += component * component.barrier
          
We linearize the source term in the same way as in `example.phase.simple.input1D`.

    >>> mXi = -(30 * phase * (1. - phase) * enthalpy \
    ...         +  4 * (0.5 - phase) * barrier)
    >>> dmXidXi = (-60 * (0.5 - phase) * enthalpy + 4 * barrier)
    >>> S1 = dmXidXi * phase * (1 - phase) + mXi * (1 - 2 * phase)
    >>> S0 = mXi * phase * (1 - phase) - phase * S1 * (S1 < 0)

    >>> phase.equation -= S0 + ImplicitSourceTerm(coeff = S1 * (S1 < 0))
    
.. note:: Adding a `Term` to an equation formed with `==` will add to the
   left-hand side of the equation and subtracting a `Term` will add to the
   right-hand side of the equation

We separate the phase field into electrode and electrolyte regimes

    >>> phase.setValue(1.)
    >>> phase.setValue(0., where=mesh.getCellCenters()[...,0] > L / 2)

Even though we are solving the steady-state problem

.. raw:: latex

   ($M_\phi = \infty$)
   
we still must sweep the solution several times to equilibrate

    >>> for step in range(10):
    ...     phase.equation.solve(var = phase)
    
.. raw:: latex

   Since we have only a single component $n$, with $\Delta\mu_n^\circ = 0$, and
   the electrostatic potential is uniform, Eq.~\eqref{eq:elphf:phase} reduces to

    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{1}{M_\xi}\frac{\partial \xi}{\partial t}
        = \kappa_{\xi}\nabla^2 \xi
        - g'(\xi) W_n
    \end{equation*}
    
which we know from `examples.phase.simple.input1D` has the analytical
solution

.. raw:: latex

   $$ \xi(x) = \frac{1}{2}(1 - \tanh\frac{x - L/2}{2d}) $$
   
with an interfacial thickness

.. raw:: latex

   $ d = \sqrt{\kappa_{\xi}/2W_n} $.
   
We verify that the correct equilibrium solution is attained

    >>> x = mesh.getCellCenters()[:,0]
    
    >>> from fipy.tools import numerix
    >>> d = numerix.sqrt(phase.gradientEnergy / (2 * solvent.barrier))
    >>> analyticalArray = (1. - numerix.tanh((x - L/2.)/(2 * d))) / 2.

    >>> phase.allclose(analyticalArray, rtol = 1e-4, atol = 1e-4).getValue()
    1
    

If we are running interactively, we plot the error

    >>> if __name__ == '__main__':
    ...     import fipy.viewers
    ...     from fipy.variables.cellVariable import CellVariable
    ...     viewer = fipy.viewers.make(vars = (phase - \
    ...         CellVariable(name = "analytical", mesh = mesh, 
    ...                      value = analyticalArray),))
    ...     viewer.plot()
