r"""

One can then solve the same problem as in
`examples/diffusion/steadyState/mesh1D/input.py` but with a periodic
mesh and no boundary conditions. The periodic mesh is used to simulate
periodic boundary conditions.

    >>> nx = 50
    >>> dx = 1.
    >>> from fipy.meshes.periodicGrid1D import PeriodicGrid1D
    >>> mesh = PeriodicGrid1D(nx = nx, dx = dx)

The variable is initially a line varying form `valueLeft` to `valueRight`.

    >>> valueLeft = 0
    >>> valueRight = 1
    >>> x = mesh.getCellCenters()[:,0]
    >>> Lx = nx * dx
    >>> initialArray = valueLeft + (valueRight - valueLeft) * x / Lx
    >>> from fipy.variables.cellVariable import CellVariable
    >>> var = CellVariable(name = "solution variable", mesh = mesh,
    ...                                                value = initialArray)

    >>> if __name__ == '__main__':
    ...     import fipy.viewers
    ...     viewer = fipy.viewers.make(vars = var,
    ...                                limits = {'datamin': 0., 'datamax': 1.})
    ...     viewer.plot()
    ...     raw_input("press key to continue")
    

A `TransientTerm` is used to provide some fixed point, otherwise the
solver has no fixed value and can become unstable.
    
    >>> from fipy.terms.transientTerm import TransientTerm
    >>> from fipy.terms.implicitDiffusionTerm import ImplicitDiffusionTerm
    >>> eq = TransientTerm(coeff = 1e-7) - ImplicitDiffusionTerm()
    >>> eq.solve(var = var)

    >>> if __name__ == '__main__':
    ...     viewer.plot()

The result of the calculation will be the average value over the domain.

   >>> var.allclose((valueLeft + valueRight) / 2., rtol = 1e-5).getValue()
   1
