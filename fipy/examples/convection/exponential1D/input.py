This example solves the steady-state convection-diffusion equation
given by:

.. raw:: latex

   $$ \nabla \cdot \left(D \nabla \phi + \vec{u} \phi \right) = 0 $$

with coefficients

.. raw:: latex

   $D = 1$ and $\vec{u} = (10,)$,
   
or

    >>> diffCoeff = 1.
    >>> convCoeff = (10.,)
    
We define a 1D mesh

.. raw:: latex

   \IndexClass{Grid1D}

..

    >>> L = 10.
    >>> nx = 10
    >>> from fipy.meshes.grid1D import Grid1D
    >>> mesh = Grid1D(dx=L / nx, nx=nx)

and impose the boundary conditions

.. raw:: latex

   $$ \phi = \begin{cases}
   0& \text{at $x = 0$,} \\
   1& \text{at $x = L$,}
   \end{cases} $$ 
   or
   \IndexClass{FixedValue}

..

    >>> valueLeft = 0.
    >>> valueRight = 1.
    >>> from fipy.boundaryConditions.fixedValue import FixedValue
    >>> boundaryConditions = (
    ...     FixedValue(faces=mesh.getFacesLeft(), value=valueLeft),
    ...     FixedValue(faces=mesh.getFacesRight(), value=valueRight),
    ...     )

The solution variable is initialized to `valueLeft`:
    
.. raw:: latex

   \IndexClass{CellVariable}

..

    >>> from fipy.variables.cellVariable import CellVariable
    >>> var = CellVariable(mesh=mesh, name = "variable")

The equation is created with the `ImplicitDiffusionTerm` and
`ExponentialConvectionTerm`. The scheme used by the convection term
needs to calculate a Peclet number and thus the diffusion term
instance must be passed to the convection term.

.. raw:: latex

   \IndexClass{ImplicitDiffusionTerm}
   \IndexClass{ExponentialConvectionTerm}

..

   >>> from fipy.terms.implicitDiffusionTerm import ImplicitDiffusionTerm
   >>> diffTerm = ImplicitDiffusionTerm(coeff=diffCoeff)
   
   >>> from fipy.terms.exponentialConvectionTerm \
   ...     import ExponentialConvectionTerm
   >>> eq = diffTerm + ExponentialConvectionTerm(coeff=convCoeff,
   ...                                           diffusionTerm=diffTerm)
   
More details of the benefits and drawbacks of each type of convection
term can be found in 

.. raw:: latex

   Section~\ref{sec:NumericalSchemes} ``\nameref{sec:NumericalSchemes}''.
   
.. of the manual

Essentially, the `ExponentialConvectionTerm` and `PowerLawConvectionTerm` will
both handle most types of convection-diffusion cases, with the
`PowerLawConvectionTerm` being more efficient.

We solve the equation

   >>> eq.solve(var=var, boundaryConditions=boundaryConditions)
   
and test the solution against the analytical result

.. raw:: latex

   $$ \phi = \frac{1 - \exp(-u_x x / D)}{1 - \exp(-u_x L / D)} $$
   or
   \IndexModule{numerix}
   \IndexFunction{exp}

..

    >>> axis = 0
    >>> x = mesh.getCellCenters()[:,axis]
    >>> from fipy.tools.numerix import exp
    >>> CC = 1. - exp(-convCoeff[axis] * x / diffCoeff)
    >>> DD = 1. - exp(-convCoeff[axis] * L / diffCoeff)
    >>> analyticalArray = CC / DD
    >>> print var.allclose(analyticalArray)
    1
   
If the problem is run interactively, we can view the result:

.. raw:: latex

   \IndexModule{viewers}

..

    >>> if __name__ == '__main__':
    ...     from fipy.viewers import make
    ...     viewer = make(vars=var)
    ...     viewer.plot()
"""
__docformat__ = 'restructuredtext'
     
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import fipy.tests.doctestPlus
    exec(fipy.tests.doctestPlus._getScript())
    
    raw_input('finished')
