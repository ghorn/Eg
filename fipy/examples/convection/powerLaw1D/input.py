This example solves the steady-state convection-diffusion equation as
described in `examples/diffusion/convection/exponential1D/input.py` but
uses the `PowerLawConvectionTerm` rather than the
`ExponentialConvectionTerm`.

    >>> L = 10.
    >>> nx = 1000
    >>> from fipy.meshes.grid1D import Grid1D
    >>> mesh = Grid1D(dx = L / nx, nx = nx)

    >>> valueLeft = 0.
    >>> valueRight = 1.

    >>> from fipy.variables.cellVariable import CellVariable
    >>> var = CellVariable(name = "concentration",
    ...                    mesh = mesh,
    ...                    value = valueLeft)

    >>> from fipy.boundaryConditions.fixedValue import FixedValue
    >>> boundaryConditions = (
    ...     FixedValue(mesh.getFacesLeft(), valueLeft),
    ...     FixedValue(mesh.getFacesRight(), valueRight),
    ... )

    >>> diffCoeff = 1.
    >>> convCoeff = (10.,)
    
    >>> from fipy.terms.implicitDiffusionTerm import ImplicitDiffusionTerm
    >>> diffTerm = ImplicitDiffusionTerm(coeff = diffCoeff)

    >>> from fipy.terms.powerLawConvectionTerm import PowerLawConvectionTerm
    >>> eq = diffTerm + PowerLawConvectionTerm(coeff = convCoeff, diffusionTerm = diffTerm)

    >>> eq.solve(var = var,
    ...          boundaryConditions = boundaryConditions)


We test the solution against the analytical result:

    >>> axis = 0
    >>> x = mesh.getCellCenters()[:,axis]
    >>> from fipy.tools import numerix
    >>> CC = 1. - numerix.exp(-convCoeff[axis] * x / diffCoeff)
    >>> DD = 1. - numerix.exp(-convCoeff[axis] * L / diffCoeff)
    >>> analyticalArray = CC / DD
    >>> print var.allclose(analyticalArray, rtol = 1e-2, atol = 1e-2) 
    1
   
If the problem is run interactively, we can view the result:

    >>> if __name__ == '__main__':
    ...     import fipy.viewers
    ...     viewer = fipy.viewers.make(vars = var)
    ...     viewer.plot()
"""
     
__docformat__ = 'restructuredtext'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import fipy.tests.doctestPlus
    exec(fipy.tests.doctestPlus._getScript())
    
    raw_input('finished')
