This example tests diffusion-convection for increasing Peclet numbers.
This test case has been introduced because `LinearCGSSolver` wsa not
working with Peclet numbers over 1. LinearLUSOlver is now the default
for ConvectionTerm. For `nx = 1000` the Linear GMRESSOLVER does not work,
but the LinearScipyGMRESSolver does work! Oh dear...

    >>> nx = 1000
